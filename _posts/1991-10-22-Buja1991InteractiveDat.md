Two basic principles for interactive visualization of high-dimensional data-focusing and linking-are discussed. Focusing techniques may involve selecting subsets, dimension reduction, or some more general manipulation of the layout information on the page or screen. A consequent of focusing is that each view only conveys partial information about the data and needs to be linked so that the information contained in individual views can be integrated into a coherent image of the data as a whole. Examples are given of how graphical data analysis methods based on focusing and linking are used in applications including linguistics, geographic information systems, time series analysis, and the analysis of multi-channel images arising in radiology and remote sensing.<<ETX>>
