In modern intensive care units (ICUs), the medical staff has to monitor a huge amount of high-dimensional and time-oriented data, which needs to be visualized user- and task-specifically to ease diagnosis and treatment planning. Available visual representations, like diagrams or charts neglect the implicit information as well as a-priory or associated knowledge about the data and its meaning (for example, 38.5째C (101.3째F) is moderate fever and 41째C (105.8째F) is critical fever). Another challenge is to provide appropriate interaction techniques to explore and navigate the data and its temporal dimensions. In this context one major challenge is to connect time-oriented data and information to a coherent interactive visualization. In this paper we present different interactive visualization techniques which enable the users to reveal the data at several levels of detail and abstraction, ranging from a broad overview to the fine structure. We will also introduce a time visualization and navigation technique that connects overview+detail, pan+zoom, and focus+context features to one powerful time-browser.
