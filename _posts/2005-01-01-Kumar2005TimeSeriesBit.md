The increasing interest in time series data mining in the last decade has resulted in the introduction of a variety of similarity measures, representations, and algorithms. Surprisingly, this massive research effort has had little impact on real world applications. Real world practitioners who work with time series on a daily basis rarely take advantage of the wealth of tools that the data mining community has made available. In this work, we attempt to address this problem by introducing a simple parameter-light tool that allows users to efficiently navigate through large collections of time series. Our system has the unique advantage that it can be embedded directly into any standard graphical user interfaces, such as Microsoft Windows, thus making deployment easier. Our approach extracts features from a time series of arbitrary length and uses information about the relative frequency of its features to color a bitmap in a principled way. By visualizing the similarities and differences within a collection of bitmaps, a user can quickly discover clusters, anomalies, and other regularities within their data collection. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a set of comprehensive experiments on real datasets from a variety of domains.
