Time is an important data dimension with distinct characteristics that is common across many application domains. This demands specialized methods in order to support proper analysis and visualization to explore trends, patterns, and relationships in different kinds of time-oriented data. The human perceptual system is highly sophisticated and specifically suited to spot visual patterns. For this reason, visualization is successfully applied in aiding these tasks. But facing the huge volumes of data to be analyzed today, applying purely visual techniques is often not sufficient. Visual analytics systems aim to bridge this gap by combining both, interactive visualization and computational analysis. In this paper, we introduce a concept for designing visual analytics frameworks and tailored visual analytics systems for time and time-oriented data. We present a number of relevant design choices and illustrate our concept by example.
