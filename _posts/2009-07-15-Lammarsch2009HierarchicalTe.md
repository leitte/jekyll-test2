Many real-world problems involve time-oriented data. Time data is different from other kinds of data--explicitly harnessing the structures of time in visualizations can guide and support users’ visual analysis processes. State-of-the-art visualizations hardly take advantage of the structures of time to aid users in understanding and exploring the data. To bring more flexibility to the analysis process, we have developed interactive visual methods incorporating the structures of time within a pixel-based visualization called GROOVE (granular overview overlay). GROOVE uses different techniques to visualize time-oriented data by overlaying several time granularities in one visualization and provides interactive operators, which utilize the structures of time in different ways to capture and explore time-oriented data.
