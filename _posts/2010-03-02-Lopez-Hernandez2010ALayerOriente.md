We present a prototype interface for visualizing and interacting with univariate time-dependent digital signals, i.e., the kind of signals that might be measured using an oscilloscope and then analyzed to find anomalies in edge timing, overshoot, or other measured characteristics. Our prototype visualizes the data using a standard eye diagram that wraps the signal in time, as well as a parallel coordinates view, and a novel 2.5D layer-based technique based on a drawer metaphor for spreading the eye diagram apart and de-occluding the traces within it. Once a “drawer” is opened, the traces within it can be sorted or grouped according to various attributes, and drilling-down into data can be achieved by opening sub-drawers. We also present a novel technique for browsing eye diagrams called temporal brushing. Initial user feedback from students in electrical engineering is reported. A video demonstrating our prototype can be downloaded at http://profs.logti.etsmtl.ca/mmcguffin/
