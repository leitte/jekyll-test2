Multidimensional time-series data is common in many fields of study, and to visualize it in a compact space while retaining dimensional context as much as possible is one of the conventional and still challenging issues for information visualization. In this paper, we propose a small technique for visualizing the detailed pattern of multidimensional time-series data without losing the sight of the whole trend. In our system, two well-known techniques of Streamgraph and Heat Map visual representations are integrated along the lines of the ``focus plus context'' philosophy. We demonstrate that interactive and spatial switchover between both representations enables us to traverse the data from microscopic to macroscopic view smoothly.
