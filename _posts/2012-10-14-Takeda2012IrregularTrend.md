We created a visualization tool called Irregular Trend Finder (ITF) for the VAST Challenge 2012 Mini Challenge 1. ITF is an interactive tool designed for analyzing large amounts of data with times-tamp and hierarchy structure in mind, so that a user can see the overview first, and then obtain more detailed information. We discovered the answers for the Challenge, and confirmed that overview first and then looking in detail is an efficient method to seek particular information in case of large amounts of data.
