Sensors have become increasingly deployed in many areas, and especially in industrial engineering settings. Sensor data is however temporal, massive, and multidimensional in nature. Such characteristics make it difficult to render sensor data for visual analysis. Although there exist potential visualizations for sensor data, there is very little specific guidance in literature on the visualization of sensor data in order to support industrial engineers in decision making. Existing visualizations are not always readily applicable to the domain of industrial engineering. This paper sheds more light on the area and proposes a visualization environment for supporting industrial engineers in their tasks.
