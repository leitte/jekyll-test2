In this paper, we present a space-efﬁcient visualization and an interaction technique for exploring time-series data on very small screens. The visualization is based on a simultaneous display of contextual visualization in the display border and focused interfaces in the center region of displays. The interaction technique utilizes ﬁsheye distortion to facilitate data selection and navigation interactions in the contextual visualization. The proposed techniques could beneﬁt a wide range of analysis applications on wearable devices. Two applications are highlighted to demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques.
