We present Qetch, a tool where users freely sketch patterns on a scale-less canvas to query time series data without specifying query length or amplitude. We study how humans sketch time series patterns --- humans preserve visually salient perceptual features but often non-uniformly scale and locally distort a pattern --- and we develop a novel matching algorithm that accounts for human sketching errors. Qetch enables the easy construction of complex and expressive queries with two key features: regular expressions over sketches and relative positioning of sketches to query multiple time-aligned series. Through user studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Qetch's different interaction features. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Qetch's matching algorithm compared to popular algorithms on targeted, and exploratory query-by-sketch search tasks on a variety of data sets.
