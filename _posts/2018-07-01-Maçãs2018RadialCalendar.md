In the analysis of time-series, it is common to focus on the identification of changing behaviours and patterns that repeat over time. In this article, we propose a visualisation model based on a radial calendar to analyse the Portuguese's consumption data. The model is intended to assist the analysts within a Portuguese Retail Company in the identification of periodic patterns and deviations from the normal consumption values. Our main contributions are: (i) the representation and characterisation of the Portuguese's consumption behaviour over time; (ii) a radial visualisation model to identify consumption patterns and their deviations; and (iii) a user case study to compare this visualisation model to a regular calendar layout. Our model has as main requirement the representation of the maximum amount of data in one single space. As such, it is ideal for analysts without prior knowledge of the data, since it provides an effective and efficient qualitative overview of the Portuguese's consumption.
