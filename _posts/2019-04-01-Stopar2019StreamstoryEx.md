This paper presents an approach for the interactive visualization, exploration and interpretation of large multivariate time series. Interesting patterns in such datasets usually appear as periodic or recurrent behavior often caused by the interaction between variables. To identify such patterns, we summarize the data as conceptual states, modeling temporal dynamics as transitions between the states. This representation can visualize large datasets with potentially billions of examples. We extend the representation to multiple spatial granularities allowing the user to find patterns on multiple scales. The result is an interactive web-based tool called StreamStory. StreamStory couples the abstraction with several tools that map the abstractions back to domain-specific concepts using techniques from statistics and machine learning. It is aimed at users who are not experts in data analytics, minimizing the number of parameters to configure out-of-the-box. We use three real-world datasets to demonstrate how StreamStory can be used to perform three main visual analytics tasks: identify the main states of a complex system and map them back to data-specific concepts, find high-level and long-term periodic behavior and traverse the scales to identify which scales exhibit interesting phenomena. We find and interpret several known, as well as previously unknown patterns in these datasets.
