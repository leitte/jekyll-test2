Multiscale visualizations are typically used to analyze multiscale processes and data in various application domains, such as the visual exploration of hierarchical genome structures in molecular biology. However, creating such multiscale visualizations remains challenging due to the plethora of existing work and the expression ambiguity in visualization research. Up to today, there has been little work to compare and categorize multiscale visualizations to understand their design practices. In this article, we present a structured literature analysis to provide an overview of common design practices in multiscale visualization research. We systematically reviewed and categorized 122 published journal or conference articles between 1995 and 2020. We organized the reviewed articles in a taxonomy that reveals common design factors. Researchers and practitioners can use our taxonomy to explore existing work to create new multiscale navigation and visualization techniques. Based on the reviewed articles, we examine research trends and highlight open research challenges.
