Trust is one of the most relevant factors when users build knowledge from visualization to predict whether they will use the represented information. In particular, trust perception is the user’s subjective evaluation of the quality and reliability of the visualized information. However, research leveraging information visualization techniques to study trust perception is limited. This work studies whether varying the temporal framing of line charts affects trust perception in an uncertain scenario. Our results suggest that granularity may be relevant for time-based visualization design. In particular, individuals trust more in a line chart with a higher number of data points and interact more with a line chart in which they trust less. These findings contribute to the state-of-the-art research in visual analytic systems by empowering designers to understand how trust perception in a health emergency scenario varies for line charts with different temporal frames.
