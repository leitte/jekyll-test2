We introduce two novel visualization designs to support practitioners in performing identification and discrimination tasks on large value ranges (i.e., several orders of magnitude) in time-series data: (1) The <italic>order of magnitude horizon</italic> graph, which extends the classic horizon graph; and (2) the <italic>order of magnitude line</italic> chart, which adapts the log-line chart. These new visualization designs visualize large value ranges by explicitly splitting the mantissa <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$m$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="tvcg-braun-3326576-eqinline-1-small.tif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> and exponent <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$e$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="tvcg-braun-3326576-eqinline-2-small.tif"/></alternatives></inline-formula> of a value <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$v=m\cdot 10^{e}$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="tvcg-braun-3326576-eqinline-3-small.tif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>. We evaluate our novel designs against the most relevant state-of-the-art visualizations in an empirical user study. It focuses on four main tasks commonly employed in the analysis of time-series and large value ranges visualization: identification, discrimination, estimation, and trend detection. For each task we analyze error, confidence, and response time. The new <italic>order of magnitude horizon</italic> graph performs better or equal to all other designs in identification, discrimination, and estimation tasks. Only for trend detection tasks, the more traditional horizon graphs reported better performance. Our results are domain-independent, only requiring time-series data with large value ranges.
